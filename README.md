# 🏆 TournamentT  

**TournamentT** is a lightweight live scoreboard system I developed for my school.  
It displays teams, stations, and rankings **in real time**.

## ✨ Features
- **Live scoreboard** (grayed out in Index.html to avoid making it feel too competitive, but still reachable by going to /ranking)
- **Customizable group names** – e.g. from “Group Green” to “Team Elephant”  
- **Persistent database** that saves everything in case the system crashes  
- **Automatic database recovery** after a failure  
- **Tablet-optimized**
- **Synchronized timer** at each station, backed by the database  
- **No Internet required**
